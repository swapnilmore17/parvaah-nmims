   <h1>Tracy McSorley</h1></center>
   
<p style="padding:10px 10px 10px 10px">Tracy McSorley is a veteran of the United States Air Force who dedicated 27 years of her life to service. She was 49 years old when I interviewed her in St. Louis, MO, on September 08, 2015.

I was medically retired in January of 2014.
I was diagnosed in the Air Force back in 2007 with depressive disorder. They just said, “You have depression.”

I had some other physical issues. I had a really bad fall, and then the combination of being on painkillers and antidepressants just took a toll. I had my first surgery for a neck injury, followed by more [painkillers]. Then I had a fall and broke my wrist, and that one resulted in three different operations over two years… with [more painkillers] and more antidepressants.

In November 2009, after twenty-something months of being on antidepressants and painkillers, I just lost my mind. I couldn’t handle the pain anymore—the physical pain, the sleeplessness, and the emotional separation that had already started in our family because of my being so sick. I’d always been very physical, and I’d always been very present in my kids’ lives, in my husband’s life. I got injured, and [with] the medications and the surgeries, it just all went away.

Within a week I realized I needed to have some serious professional help, and I asked to be admitted to the hospital.

I tried to overdose in November of 2009, and I wasn’t successful. Within a week I realized I needed to have some serious professional help, and I asked to be admitted to the hospital. I spent three weeks at the Barnes-Jewish Psychiatric Ward. I’ve been seeing my psychiatrist and my psychologist ever since then, but life and living take its toll, in spite of everything. And there’s always these other things that keep happening along the way, so I’m kinda in a transition right now.

I’ve been finally accepted as a veteran into the VA intensive outpatient program. That starts this week. It’s taken a little while to get into the program. I had another hospitalization, because [my marriage ended earlier this year]. I’ve been struggling trying to deal with things, and in July I said, “I can’t take it anymore,” and I made a plan to get out again. [I went to] get some help and made some changes to my meds. They’re still making changes to my meds now.

It’s been difficult, but I get up in the morning, and I have a dog. It’s amazing! The dog needs things, and sometimes it’s easier to satisfy the dog more than anyone in my life, so the dog gets his walk, he gets fed, he gets what he needs, and in turn, I get what I need. I make sure that I eat, I make sure I get out, and I make sure I do what I gotta do.

I’m in a state of transition right now, trying to figure out what’s next. At 49, it’s like it’s half over and there’s half left. I kinda have to think more that my cup is half full, even though I feel like my cup is half empty right now. My husband and I are getting divorced after ten years of marriage and a fifteen year relationship… even though I’m under treatment and medication, it’s been a really rough eight years. Some days get better, and some days aren’t. That’s really taken a toll. I’m grateful that our kids are grown up. Our three children are 24, 22, and 21. They’re all out of the house, and they all seem to be successful adults living their lives, doing what they gotta do. I’m glad and grateful for that, but I’m mourning a loss right now. This transition of being married and in a relationship, and now that being gone, is adding some complications to my life that I wasn’t foreseeing…

Des: Divorces are awful.

Tracy: Worse than death. I handled my father’s dying back in 2005. I didn’t grieve nearly as much as I feel like I’m grieving now for the loss of this relationship—and the fact that it’s not over, it’s still in progress… Divorce is tough, Being a child of a divorce doesn’t help, but it is what it is.

Des: Talk to me about the VA and being diagnosed in active military. Vets don’t really talk.

Tracy: Vets really don’t talk, [even with] as much training as we get every year on suicide awareness—as much as they made a push over the past ten years, maybe. They put us through this resiliency training. But, the culture of being in the military—it really doesn’t matter which service you’re in—you really have a warrior mentality. You have to take care of yourself and you have to take care of your buddies. When you have that weak link, no matter what the reason is, there’s a level of isolation, there’s a level of ostracism. If you can’t carry your weight, whether it’s the pack on your back or your mental health issues, it turns back on you.

That was a very difficult thing, especially after over 20 years of being in the military and being in a senior non-commissioned officer position. After everything I had given to them, I didn’t expect for them to turn on me and not [give] back to me.

The commander I was under at the time couldn’t see my mental illness, except through the veil of her mental illness. She had SAD. [She’d say], “I had Seasonal Affective Disorder. Just take a pill and get over it.”

It was like, “This is a little more intense than that…” Even though you try to be forthcoming, the consequences start. You try to be honest. They always tell you to be honest, but tell them the story and yet… the repercussions and the retaliations had started.

Fighting to be medically-retired, versus just retiring, was harder. It took four years to get that done. But I was really lucky, because the VA actually came through for me, way better than the Air Force and the active duty Air Force did. The VA has been there for me; my plan and request for assistance was settled relatively quickly. The VA here in St. Louis has had some issues in the news with their dental clinic and things like that, but I have to tell you, their psychiatric unit at the Jefferson Barracks mental health clinic is fantastic.

I wish that more veterans and service members would get out there and say what the problems are. I think that, as the war draws down and there are more people being affected, we’re going to start seeing this. I know that as I walk through the halls and talk to people now, I know that I see more people coming out and saying, “This is a problem for me,” but they’re not in the military anymore. As a veteran you’re retired, so you don’t have the stigma of your organization and your warrior mentality to deal with.

I’ve been really fortunate. The VA has definitely really been there for me in ways that I couldn’t have foreseen; even as a woman veteran, they have been there for me.

Des: The information that has been coming out recently is that most of the [service members] who have died from suicide did not see active combat. We like to assume active combat is the reason they wanted to die, so what is the disparity there?

Tracy: Do you know what survivor’s guilt is?

You just don’t feel like you’re doing enough. You don’t feel like you’ve been chosen for that, and that also kind of weighs on you because you wonder why.

When you’re not in the combat zone—whether it’s something that you’ve chosen, or it’s been chosen for you—you have a tremendous amount of guilt when there are other people out there fighting that fight. Even though you may be in a supporting role, even though you may have a very critical component of fighting that war, but not in a direct combat role, it actually can take its toll on you. You just don’t feel like you’re doing enough. You don’t feel like you’ve been chosen for that, and that also kind of weighs on you because you wonder why.

It’s something that I talk with other veterans about, especially in the NAMI military family support group. As we’ve all discussed it, that is one of the things we seem to think is a problem. There’s a sense of survivor’s guilt, of not doing enough, as much as you’ve done, because you haven’t been in an active combat role. When you know the toll that the individual service members and their families are taking, and you kind of have it a little bit easy, it makes it a little difficult.

The only exception I feel is the pilots and the service members [in the] unarmed aerial vehicle program—the drone program—they’re not directly in the field, but they’re still having a very active role in surveillance and indirectly [killing and eliminating] threats. That actually takes a different kind of mindset, because you’re in this comfort zone, if you will. You’re in this coffee shop, for example, and you’re playing this video game, yet the consequences of this virtual reality… it’s not virtual anymore. It’s very real, and we don’t have the experience yet to deal with what these individuals are dealing with. As they have to go through this process, they get to go home every night and be with their mother, their wife, their significant other, their kids. But they were, just a few hours ago, out there doing surveillance and they had to hit somebody.

[Members of my family] are in Air Force Special Ops. The base they were assigned to in New Mexico has had, over the past five years, quite a significant number of suicides on the base. One of my sister’s troops was one of them. She felt absolutely horrified, because she couldn’t believe one of her airmen would do something like that, but it was something that did happen, and it takes its toll on you, and you don’t realize it. It has its own kind of mental acuity, these situations that we don’t know how to deal with yet. This is a brand new way of waging war. It’s not something we ever did, this remote reality that we’re dealing with. We’ve done [hand-to-hand combat] for thousands of years. We’ve prepared for that to a certain extent. This is a new thing, and we don’t know how to help with people who are doing it and have problems.

 

Suicide for veterans and service members, a lot of it is from survivor’s guilt of not doing enough either for your direct buddy or your command, or whatever. I know that, to a certain extent, I played a part in it. Having my husband deployed and being deployed… He deployed more than me; we were a joint military family. Between 2001 and 2012, he deployed six times, [for six to ten months at a time]. Those separations took their toll on us, too. My own deployments, supporting missions that I had to take care of, also took their toll.

Des: We hear a lot about assimilating back into society. I’m curious, what is it about assimilation?

Tracy: From the very first day that you start your basic training, you’re being torn down and then you’re built back up. That tear down is vital, not just for you as an individual, but for every single person that’s in your life there—they’re all there to become airmen. That build up is pretty significant, especially when you take into consideration the Air Force core values, which are: integrity first; service before self; and excellence in all you do. When you start living your life in that uniform to that standard, it transforms you. I mean, when you’ve done it for over 20 years, it’s in you. It’s in your blood. It’s in your DNA. It doesn’t go away.

But then, you’re back out there and you look around, and there’s a lot of people who don’t have those core values. In the corporate world especially, as it exists in our world today. There’s a lot of disconnect and it’s hard to make that assimilation. There are certain venues that most veterans have been sticking to—one is going to the VA. A lot of us have gone back to be Department of Defense contractors or civil service employees within the government because it’s kind of familiar to us.

It’s a difficult transition. There’s such a small minority of people who serve in the military on a volunteer basis, and there’s even fewer that serve in a combat role. The war you see on television and the war you see in the movies is not the war that any of us fights. It’s not that way at all. It’s very personal. Trying to talk to people about it outside of your group, or your battle buddies, is hard. And a lot of people don’t want to hear it.

Des: That difficulty talking about experiences in the military sounds like the difficulties of talking about suicide overall. Is there anything about the military and mental difficulties or suicide, that you want to address?

Tracy: I think they have made strides within the Department of Defense to hire and get the right people in to do the jobs, whether by hiring or contracting out the positions for psychiatric nurses and doctors, psychologists, and social workers. But we have this constant battle of funding for these miscellaneous health programs and funding the weapons system. Congress doesn’t like funding the mental health issues. Congress doesn’t like funding the veterans benefits, as much as they say they’ll do it. They’re already talking about figuring out ways to cut back on it. They have a short-term perspective.

That’s a new battle I see many of the vets getting involved in, becoming activists in our local communities. We’re lucky right now that St. Louis is seriously considering setting up a Veteran’s Court in the surrounding counties and communities… because we are still having problems, and they’ll deal with some of the special issues that veterans have. There is still a huge amount of self-medication, drugs, and alcohol that continue to this day. Part of it is because of that constant battle: it’s easier to take that drink or have that hit than to take your medication, because your medication keeps getting changed. It’s just better to cut it off and not do anything about it, [to say], “I don’t want to deal with it. It’s done.” You’re not feeling anything at all; trying to work through the medications is difficult. I know that I have suffered through that.

There’s this disconnect within our congressional system; they’re becoming more involved and realizing that that’s part of the problem that we’re fighting. It’s not just now. It’s going to get worse later. So, [the veterans] have been getting out there and fighting for that.

Des: I think that’s what I was trying to get at before. It seems like there’s a lot more talk than there is action. That concerns me, because there’s the talk, there’s the media, and a little action, but is it actually real? The VA has been getting a lot of flak. Where is the reality? It’s a shame.

Tracy: It is a shame.

Des: I’m glad you had a good experience.

Tracy: I’ve been very lucky with the VA. I cannot complain about what the VA’s done for me at all. Not since I reached out to them and really got the help that I needed, both financially and medically—the treatments that I needed. They were there for me.

Des: I have a couple of friends who are clinicians at the VA in Baton Rouge. They’re incredible people. Are there not enough clinicians? Not enough funding? What is it?

Some of the veterans are really afraid to go into the system because all they hear are the horror stories.

Tracy: It doesn’t help that our media continues to berate. It’s one of the things that I think more veterans are having a problem with, because all they hear are the horror stories about the VA. There were not enough people out there saying, “I’ve had a good relationship, and I’ve had benefits from them that have helped me cope with things.” There are not enough voices out there for that. Some of the veterans are really afraid to go into the system because all they hear are the horror stories.

[That is] one more reason why I post on Facebook, because I’ve had many good experiences with the VA. If you have a claim, file it. If you have medical issues, make sure you get it in the system, because the only way you’re going to get help is if you say something. You’ve got to be that squeaky wheel before you can get a little bit of grease. They’ve been there for me, even with the funding constraints and problems that they’ve had. I can’t say that they haven’t when they have. Every couple of weeks I get a phone call saying, “Are you hanging in there?” So, I can’t complain at all.

 

Des: Talk to me about your experiences with medication.

Tracy: Medication has been one of the most difficult things. Early on with my diagnosis, I wasn’t seeing professionals in the psychiatric/psychology sector; I was being seen by a general practitioner. The general practitioner, you know, we talked. They said, “You’re depressed, I’m going to prescribe this for you.” That was good, except I was also on these other narcotics. Over two years, I was on a bunch of different narcotic/opiate prescriptions, as well as being on a couple different antidepressants. Even though I was constantly showing people [what medications I was on], no one was making the correlation that my depression was worsening.

It wasn’t until I pushed to get out of the general practitioner’s office, after my suicide attempt, to actually seek more professional psychiatric guidance, that things started to get a little bit better. I could say, though, that since 2009 and my psychiatric hospitalization, I have been on eight different medications. Just this past year, I’ve been on four different prescriptions, trying to find the right balance, trying to find the right dosage of what’s going to help me stabilize and keep my mind where it needs to be. [My brain is changing. I’m aging. I’m a perimenopausal woman. My hormones are changing. And it’s all hitting at the same time.]

So… medication has definitely been a challenge.

Des: What kind of toll does it take?

Tracy: I’ll tell you, when I was on Cymbalta, I didn’t feel anything. I wasn’t present in my husband’s life, I wasn’t present in my kids’ lives, I wasn’t present in my own life. I was physically there, but looking back, I felt like I was the walking dead.

When I started to fight with my clinician to get off the meds or try to bring down the dosage…it was a fight. I said, “I can’t handle not feeling anything anymore. This isn’t helping me. I need to be more involved. I’m not there. It’s taking its toll on my relationships.”

They said, “You need the medication.”

I said, “Can’t we make some adjustments?”

They said, “No, you gotta stay on them.”

I decided on my own that I was going to ween myself off and down, over a period of several months. I was completely off of meds by [spring] of 2013. No more Cymbalta, no more pain medications, no more anything. Started seeing my psychologist more frequently… That’s really when I started reaching out to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and other organizations.

Unfortunately, I was at a point of stress in my relationship with my husband. Things had continued to deteriorate, despite trying to do therapy and things like that. There were some stresses with our [family], and I had to get put back on medication…

Des: Do you need medication?

Tracy: I’d like to think that I don’t need medication, but the Lexapro has helped. It’s given me a little more clarity in my brain, a little more focus and attention that I didn’t have. It felt like I was in a fog often as my stressors increased. My body’s self-defense mechanism puts this blind up, this shade between me and what’s out there, and it was affecting other things. It caused problems. This [medication] has helped me to bridge that, and bring the light back in when I was feeling all this other darkness.

I continue to be on the Lexapro right now, but other medications they are trying to implement with it are giving me problems. [I had to come off Wellbutrin because that and epinephrine caused my blood pressure to exponentially increase.] I can’t afford a heart problem, so I had to change that. I’ve taken other medications along the way, but right now I’m sticking with the Lexapro and we’re trying to make an adjustment on the other dosages.

As much as I want to say I don’t need meds, with all the changes that are happening in my head and physically, I have to do something. Doing something is better than doing nothing.

Des: What else helps?

Tracy: Exercise and watching my diet. Since August 2013, I’ve lost 25 pounds. I’ve eliminated red meat, pretty much, from my diet. I don’t drink very often. I’ll have a beer on occasion or maybe a glass of wine. A mixed drink once in a while, but with the medications I’m on, that’s really hard.</p>
