# Parvaah - Suicide Prevention Portal
This project was made in a 12 hour hackathon at NMIMS, Mumbai.
The goal of this project is to diminish this crisis in our country by providing different modules
to help the impacted personnel. Modules like games, chat forums, one-to-one chat and
depression evaluating tests can help both the individual by instilling him/her with positive
thoughts and also the organization by understanding the group of people and areas being
affecting the most.

## Technologies: 

Project development: Web Development
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, Bootstrap
Backend: Python, Node.js, MongoDB, ExpressJS

## Features
 - Evaluating test: 
This module of our project is a test of 10 questions to evaluate the degree of depression in the user and the intensity with which the organization will observe the user. 
There are 3 degrees of depression in a user, namely, level 1, level 2, and level 3.
The score of the quiz ranges between 10 and 40, 40 being the most vulnerable user.
This quiz will be given by the user after registration and his level will be evaluated.
His response will also be recorded so that the admin may offer additional help later on.

 - Games: 
Here, we have included some arcade games to balance the user’s mind by providing a soothing
experience.
 
 - Calming ubiquity: 
We have included soothing images, and motivational quotes so that the user gets a calm vibe.
One more thing we have focused on is, we have included a calming nature’s sound which will be played in the
background everytime the site is loaded. 

 - Working on adding a anonymous forums module and a data analysis tool to aggregate data by region and age.
